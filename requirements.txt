pandas>=1.3.0             # Data manipulation and CSV I/O
tenacity>=8.0.1           # Retry logic for API calls and scraping
tqdm>=4.61.0              # Progress bars for loops
beautifulsoup4>=4.9.3    # HTML parsing for web scraping
fuzzywuzzy~=0.18.0        # Fuzzy string matching (e.g., legislator names)
python-Levenshtein>=0.12.2 # Performance enhancement for fuzzywuzzy (requires C build tools)
python-dotenv
thefuzz[speedup]
# Add Playwright for browser automation

requests-cache # Added for HTTP request caching

# --- Data Processing & Feature Engineering (Includes Core & Planned) ---
numpy~=1.26.4             # Numerical operations (dependency of pandas, good to pin)
scikit-learn~=1.5.0       # Preprocessing, modeling utilities, evaluation metrics
geopandas~=0.14.3         # Geospatial data handling (Planned for demographics)
# Note: Installing geopandas can be complex due to C dependencies (GDAL, GEOS, PROJ).
# Using Conda (conda install geopandas) is often recommended.
# Explicitly listing key geopandas dependencies for clarity, versions align with geopandas 0.14.x
shapely~=2.0.3            # Geospatial geometry operations
fiona~=1.9.6              # Reading/writing geospatial data formats

# --- Modeling & Interpretation (Planned) ---
xgboost~=2.0.3            # Gradient Boosting model (Primary planned model)
shap~=0.45.0              # Model interpretation (SHAP values)
matplotlib~=3.8.3         # Plotting library (for evaluation, SHAP plots)
seaborn~=0.13.2           # Enhanced plotting based on matplotlib

# --- Optional Tools (Based on Planned Features/Workflow) ---
# optuna~=3.6.1             # (Optional) Hyperparameter optimization framework
# mlflow~=2.11.3            # (Optional) Experiment tracking and model management
# flask~=3.0.2              # (Optional) Web framework for simple prediction API
# streamlit~=1.34.0         # (Optional) Web framework for interactive dashboard/interface

# Development/Testing (Optional, but recommended)
